        <h2>My Goals and Intended Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>By learning this course: CISC3003 Web Programming, I hope to explore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How websites work and interact with users and servers.</li>
            <li>How I can use HTML to layout my desired webpage. </li>
            <li>How I can use CSS to style my webpage and make the contents look smooth and colorful.</li>
            <li>How I can use JavaScript to make the webpage functional and interactive with the users.</li>
            <li>How I can deal with the webpage interacting with the server and database.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And <b>MOST IMPORTANTLY</b>, how I can apply these knowledge into game development.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Development Planning</h2>
        <p>Since game development requires a wide range of skills (e.g. coding, graphics design, scriptwriting, etc.), I would like to:</p>
        <ul>
  <li>
    Watch a lot of films and movies for
    <ul>
      <li>learning to write interesting and coherent stories,</li>
      <li>exploring different settings for my future games.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn programming and algorithms for
    <ul>
      <li>coding in different game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine,</li>
      <li>coding mechanics such as object rendering and character movements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn some soft skills, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>Teamwork, since game development involves large and multidisciplinary teams,</li>
      <li>Communication, for sharing ideas across programmers, artists and designers,</li>
      <li>Project Management, for fast and agile methodologies to save development duration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

        <h2>My Reflection and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>Throughout these years, I feel like I am in the right track of pursuing to be a game developer, well, actually in my imagination... All I did was playing and enjoying my life, and nothing about my future job. That's why I have to step up now and get things going. For instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jot down whatever ideas I have at the moment for storytelling.</li>
            <li>Constantly learn coding and algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
